A lot of what was done and written here is thanks to Mas Agustiar (for the supervised learning materials/tricks/dataset) and especially to Mas Mamduh @mamduhmahfudzi: materials and ideas he shared, the exercise he is assigning--the one I am doing right now, AND his repository that makes this API and app possible: https://github.com/mamduhmahfudzi/credit-scorer.
