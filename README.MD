Here the source codes and all the dependencies that enable the heroku app that does the prediction of whether a potential creditor would default based on these values stored on input format below. 

input format:
<pre> 
 {
   "person_age": 30,
  "person_income": 82000,
  "person_home_ownership": "MORTGAGE",

  "loan_intent": "PERSONAL",
  "loan_grade": "A",
  "loan_amnt": 5000,
  "loan_int_rate": 6.76,
  "loan_percent_income": 0.06,
  "cb_person_default_on_file": "N",
  "cb_person_cred_hist_length": 8
 }
 </pre> 

expected test proba result from above input: .004475969355553389

expected output format:
<pre> 
{
 'model':'credit-risk-scorer-dari-modul-agustiar',
 'risky':False,
 'score_proba':.004475969355553389,

A lot of what was done and written here is thanks to Mas Agustiar (for the supervised learning materials/tricks/dataset) and especially to Mas Mamduh @mamduhmahfudzi: materials and ideas he shared, the exercise he is assigning--the one I am doing right now, AND his repository that makes this API and app possible: https://github.com/mamduhmahfudzi/credit-scorer.
